# viewsyncrelay config file

# Actions tell viewsyncrelay to do something when a packet matches some conditions
# "repeat" values can be:
#   DEFAULT:
#       Run the first time a packet matches conditions. Don't run again until
#       after we get a packet that *doesn't* match the constraints
#   ALL: Run each time a packet matches thesse constraints
#   ONCE: Run once (duh!)
#   RESET: Allows a reset_constraints section exactly like the constraints
#       section. Runs the action once, but resets when the reset_constraints
#       are matched, allowing the action to run again. These actions also allow
#       an "initially_disabled" field, which, when set, means the action needs
#       to be reset *before* it can run at all. Note that the presence of the
#       initially_disabled key is sufficient to make it disabled; the value of
#       the key doesn't matter.
